# Python-Scripts
Useful Python scripts for various daily tasks and applications.

# For All Files:
All files will have a variable **show_console** and will by default set to **False**.
If you would like to see the console, or debug a script for any purposes, just edit the variable to **True**.

# Sorting "Python" Folders
By running **Sort Python Folders.py**, all folders that have a python script in them will be renamed to "Python - {previous_name}", and then moved to a new folder called "Python Programming"

# Organizing Directory
By running **Organizer.py**, all of the implemented files in the directory will be sorted into their own folders. A text file containing the **To and From** details will be created with the current Date, Hour, Minute, and Second. Copy and paste this file name into the prompt when reverting the file movements.
